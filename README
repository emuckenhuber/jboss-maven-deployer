GETTING STARTED

- get the sources
- run mvn assembly:assembly
- copy target/maven-classpath-deployer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-distribution.jar to $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deployers
- start AS
- add a pom.xml to your deployments meta data locations (e.g. META-INF)
  > all artifacts defined in the pom will be added to the deployments classpath

Known Issues
 - the resolution is hell slow
 - it uses the maven dependency algorithm
